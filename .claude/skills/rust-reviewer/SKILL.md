# Rust Pragmatist

Pragmatic code review skill for Rust projects that provides actionable improvement suggestions.

## Instructions
Review the modified code against the Pragmatic Rust Guidelines in @/Users/ccustine/Downloads/pragmatic_rust.md

## Output Format

Provide feedback as an **actionable checklist** with this structure:

```markdown
## ðŸ¦€ Rust Code Review

### âœ… What's Good
- [Specific positive patterns observed]

### ðŸ”§ Suggested Improvements

**[Category: Universal, Libraries, Interoperability, UX, Resilience, Building, Applications, FFI, Safety, Performance, Documentation, AI]**
- [ ] **[File:Line]** - [Issue description]
  - **Current**: `[problematic code snippet]`
  - **Suggested**: `[improved code snippet]`
  - **Why**: [Brief explanation of the benefit]

[Repeat for each issue found]

### ðŸ“Š Summary
- Issues found: [count by category]
- Priority: [High/Medium/Low issues]
```

## Review Priorities

Use this severity guide:
- **ðŸ”´ High**: Safety issues, panics, data races, unsound unsafe code
- **ðŸŸ¡ Medium**: Performance problems, non-idiomatic code, missing error handling
- **ðŸŸ¢ Low**: Style preferences, minor optimizations, documentation improvements

## Examples

### Example 1: Clone to Borrow

**Current**:
```rust
fn process_data(data: String) -> usize {
    data.len()
}
// Called with: process_data(my_string.clone())
```

**Suggested**:
```rust
fn process_data(data: &str) -> usize {
    data.len()
}
// Called with: process_data(&my_string)
```

**Why**: Avoids allocation; function doesn't need ownership.

### Example 2: Iterator Efficiency

**Current**:
```rust
let mut results = Vec::new();
for item in items.iter() {
    if item.is_valid() {
        results.push(item.process());
    }
}
```

**Suggested**:
```rust
let results: Vec<_> = items.iter()
    .filter(|item| item.is_valid())
    .map(|item| item.process())
    .collect();
```

**Why**: More idiomatic, potentially more efficient through iterator fusion.

### Example 3: Error Handling

**Current**:
```rust
let file = File::open("config.txt").unwrap();
```

**Suggested**:
```rust
let file = File::open("config.txt")
    .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to open config: {}", e))?;
```

**Why**: Graceful error propagation instead of panicking.

## Best Practices Reference

### Common Anti-Patterns to Flag
1. `.clone()` used to satisfy borrow checker without understanding ownership
2. `unwrap()` in production code without explicit panic documentation
3. String concatenation in loops using `+` instead of collecting into a buffer
4. Manual index iteration when iterators would work
5. `Arc<Mutex<T>>` when `&T` or channels would suffice
6. Public struct fields without accessor methods
7. Missing `#[derive(Debug)]` on public types

### Rust-Specific Optimizations
1. Use `Cow<str>` when sometimes cloning, sometimes borrowing
2. Consider `SmallVec` or `ArrayVec` for small, bounded collections
3. Use `Box<str>` instead of `String` for immutable strings
4. Leverage `std::mem::replace` or `std::mem::take` to avoid clones
5. Use `OnceCell` or `lazy_static` for one-time initialization

## Activation Context

This skill activates when:
- User edits `.rs` files (auto-trigger after modifications)
- User explicitly requests code review
- User asks about Rust best practices or patterns
- User is about to commit Rust code changes

**Do not activate for**:
- Reading existing code without modifications
- Documentation-only changes
- Cargo.toml or config file edits

## Tool Usage

- **Read**: Examine the modified Rust files and surrounding context
- **Grep**: Search for patterns across the codebase (e.g., finding all `.unwrap()` calls)
- **Edit**: Only when explicitly requested to apply suggestions

**Note**: Present suggestions but let the user decide whether to apply them unless they explicitly ask you to make the changes.
